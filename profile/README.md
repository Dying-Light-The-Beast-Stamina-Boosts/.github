## üìñ Overview

In *Dying Light: The Beast*, stamina governs everything: sprinting, climbing, dodging, and melee attacks. While realism adds intensity, stamina limits can sometimes slow down the thrill of fluid gameplay. This trainer removes those barriers with **stamina-focused enhancements**, letting you chain wall runs, leap attacks, and combos endlessly.

[!NOTE]
Designed for **offline/single-player freedom**. Do not use in online or competitive modes.
